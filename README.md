# This analysis combines school-specific data with student data from each school.

# It provides a high-level district summary for all schools along, and provides school-level summaries for each given school in the district

# There are additional comparisons based on passing rates of math and reading, budget per student, by grade levels, school size, and school type.

# Based on the overall passing rate of both subjects, the top five and bottom five performing schools are ranked.

# Need: The business requirements document (BRD) requires a display of the results set, and an exported .txt file with the same output.
